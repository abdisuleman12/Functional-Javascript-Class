functional programming
breaking coding into verbs, whereas object-oriented programming is the nouns

(not functional reactive programming) => observable streams
look into observables courses - async js and the advanced course - TASK

look up "ramda" - js library that is more advanced than lodash or underscore

NEXT => "functional lite" - course that is makes applicable, readable code - TASK
(kyle siumpson)

for some of the deeper bugs in JS like null = object instead of null, watch
Deep Javascript course - TASK (kyle simpson)

holding an object constant use Object.freeze
can use a module called deepfreeze to recursively freeze objects on objects, as freeze
only goes 1 level

TODO - get a better handle on using _.each, _.map, _.filter

Array.from(/* an array-like object */) is basically
Array.prototype.slice.call(Object)
